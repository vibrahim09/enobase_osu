### Intro

Enobase is a next-generation platform designed to help businesses create custom applications using no-code building blocks like documents, databases, and automations, similar to tools like Notion and Airtable. We empower businesses to develop systems tailored to their needs, such as vacation tracking, recruitment platforms, and accounting solutions.
To streamline the onboarding process and help users get started quickly, we want to explore leveraging large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4o/1o, to enable users to build applications through natural language interaction. Your task will be to develop a system where users can:

1. Communicate with an LLM to describe the business application they want to create.
2. The LLM will then interact with the no-code tools to generate a fully functioning application based on the user’s prompt.
   Built-in rag to retrieve relevant content 
   Generate pages with blocks content
   Generate dynamic data model
   Generate queries, formulas, and charts based on the dynamic data models
   Generate custom component based on a design system (i.e. like https://v0.dev)
   

### Objectives
Build a conversational interface where users can discuss their requirements with an LLM.
Integrate the LLM with the no-code platform and the current data model and data to generate blocks and full applications based on user prompts.
Verify that the output is functional.
Demo the system’s capabilities.

### Motivations
Enobase aims to simplify the process of building and customizing business tools, enabling companies to efficiently manage their operations. By integrating LLMs, we can lower the barrier to entry for users, allowing them to create complex applications with minimal technical knowledge. This project has the potential to significantly improve productivity for businesses, solving real-world problems by making enterprise tools more accessible and adaptable.
